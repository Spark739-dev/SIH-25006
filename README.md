## Problem Title
SIH 25006: Development of a Digital Farm Management Portal for implementing Biosecurity measures in Pig and Poultry Farms
## Problem Description
### Background

Biosecurity is a cornerstone of animal health management, particularly in the pig and poultry sectors, where disease outbreaks such as Avian Influenza and African Swine Fever can cause significant economic losses, threaten food security, and disrupt rural livelihoods. Despite its importance, many farmers—especially smallholders in resource-limited areas—struggle to access practical, actionable information on biosecurity protocols, risk assessment tools, and regulatory compliance requirements.

### Problem Description

There is an urgent need for a user-friendly, digital platform that empowers farmers to implement, monitor, and sustain robust biosecurity practices on their farms. This portal should offer end-to-end solutions for farm-level biosecurity management by integrating:

• Customizable risk assessment tools based on local epidemiological conditions.
• Interactive training modules and best practice guidelines tailored for pig and poultry production systems.
• Compliance tracking features aligned with regulatory frameworks to help farmers work toward disease-free compartment recognition.
• Real-time alerts and monitoring dashboards for disease outbreaks and biosecurity breaches.
• Multilingual and mobile-first design to ensure accessibility in remote and rural areas.

The platform should also enable data collection and analysis for policy support, foster collaborative networking among stakeholders (farmers, veterinarians, extension workers, etc.), and promote long-term resilience and sustainability in the livestock sector.

### Expected Outcomes

• Enhanced farmer awareness and education on biosecurity.
• Improved risk management at the farm level as well as self-assessment.
• Easy access to customized biosecurity protocols and guidelines.
• Digital record-keeping and compliance tracking.
• Timely alerts and disease notifications to farmers.
• Healthier livestock and increased farm productivity.
• Empowerment of small and marginal farmers with limited resources.
• Support to authorities in data-driven surveillance and policy making.
• Stronger collaboration across the livestock ecosystem.
• Improved national preparedness for zoonotic and transboundary diseases.

## Proposed Solution
BioSecureNet – An Integrated Digital Biosecurity Enforcement & Farm Intelligence System

Our solution, BioSecureNet, is a comprehensive digital platform that enables pig and poultry farms to implement, monitor, analyse, and enforce biosecurity protocols using intelligent automation, IoT-based sensing, advanced analytics, and decision-support tools.

### 1. Detailed explanation of the proposed solution ###

BioSecureNet is built around four key pillars:

#### a) Biosecurity Workflow Automation

Digital SOP checklists for worker tasks, disinfection, feed handling, PPE checks, waste management, rodent inspection, vaccination, and quarantine routines.

Each task is time-stamped, GPS-validated, and photo-verified using AI-based image consistency checks.

Visitors & vehicles must pass through a digital gate-entry module that verifies biosecurity compliance before access.

#### b) Real-Time Environment & Health Monitoring

IoT sensors continuously record temperature, humidity, ammonia, CO₂, water flow, feed intake, and animal activity.

A local gateway creates alerts instantly even during internet downtime.

Sensor anomalies automatically trigger corrective-action tasks.

#### c) Intelligent Risk Prediction & Biosecurity Breach Detection

### A unique contrastive-learning-based biosecurity risk model evaluates: 

1. Environmental deviations

2. Mortality spikes

3. Visitor density

4. Worker compliance gaps

5. Movement patterns

The system generates ranked alerts and prevention recommendations.

#### d) Digital Traceability & Compliance Evidence

Every vaccination, movement, mortality record, and environment reading is stored in a Merkle-based traceability ledger.

Farms can generate export-quality disease-free certification reports

### 2. How it addresses the problem ###

Pig and poultry farms face repeated disease outbreaks due to poor compliance, lack of real-time visibility, and no structured reporting.
BioSecureNet addresses these by: 

A. Reducing human error via automated reminders and digital SOPs

B. Detecting risky conditions before disease spreads

C. Reducing disease entry through strict digital visitor control

D. Ensuring regulatory readiness with complete traceability

E. Improving productivity through environment optimization

### 3. Innovation and uniqueness of the solution: 

A. Contrastive-Adjusted Composite Risk Engine (CACR) – hybrid ML + anomaly detection model specifically designed for livestock biosecurity.

B. AI-verified SOP completion images to prevent false entries.

C. Merkle-attested micro-ledger for tamper-proof farm event records.

D. Bio-Credit Reward System where workers earn points for compliant behaviour.

E. Offline-First Architecture enabling full operation in rural farms with poor connectivity.
## Technical Approach
### 1. Technologies to be used

A. Backend: FastAPI / Node.js microservices

B. Frontend: React + Flutter mobile app

C. IoT Stack: MQTT, LoRaWAN gateways, local SQLite edge buffer

D.Databases: PostgreSQL, TimescaleDB for sensor time-series

E. AI/ML: XGBoost, PyTorch contrastive encoder, SHAP explainability

F. Security: OAuth2.0, JWT, Merkle hashing for event logs

G. DevOps: Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions

### 2. Methodology and process for implementation:
   
#### a) Requirement Analysis & Farm Workflow Mapping:

-> Understanding specific disease control procedures, farm routines, ventilation systems, and common outbreak patterns.

#### b) System Architecture Design:

-> Modular microservices

-> Role-based dashboards

-> Edge + cloud hybrid design

#### c) IoT Integration:

-> Sensors are installed inside poultry houses

-> LoRa/MQTT gateway collects data and streams to cloud

-> Local rule engine generates alerts when offline

#### d) ML Risk Engine:

-> Collect healthy vs outbreak patterns

-> Train contrastive model to create farm-specific risk profiles

-> Deploy on cloud with fallback on gateway light-model

#### e) UI/UX Development:

-> Worker-friendly mobile app

-> Farm manager & vet dashboards

-> Monthly compliance reports

#### f) Testing, Validation & Pilot Deployment:

-> Field testing on 2–3 farms

-> Calibration of envi1. Analysis of feasibility

-> User feedback integration

## Feasibility and Viability
### 1. Analysis of feasibility:

-> IoT hardware is low-cost and widely available.

-> Runs even in low-connectivity regions (edge computing).

-> Software stack uses open-source technologies → cost-effective.

-> ML models require minimal data due to contrastive learning.

### 2. Potential challenges and risks:

-> Sensor calibration inconsistencies

-> Workers ignoring digital checklists

-> Data privacy concerns

-> Resistance to adopting new technology

### 3. Strategies for overcoming these challenges:

-> Auto-calibration reminders and stability-based sensor validation

-> Gamified Bio-Credit reward system to motivate workers

-> Differential privacy for shared datasets

-> Simple local-language UI with voice guidance

## Impact and Benefits
### 1. Potential impact on the target audience:

-> Helps farmers maintain disease-free farms
